&lt;h2 id=&#34;microservices&#34;&gt;Microservices&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All three editions are built on top of Light-Java framework as microservices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Development edition has only one service with two endpoints for code and token.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enterprise edition has six microservices and each serivce has several endpoints to support user login,
access token retrieval, user registration, service registration, client registration and public
key certificate distribution. It can support millions users and thousands of clients
and services with scopes. It should be easily handle thousands of concurrent users per
instance and each service can be scaled individually if necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;in-memory-data-grid&#34;&gt;In-Memory Data Grid&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hazelcast is used as Data Grid across multiple services and majority of operations
won&amp;rsquo;t hit database server for best performance. This also makes database as plugin
so that persistence layer can be anything from SQL to NoSQL.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;built-in-security&#34;&gt;Built-in Security&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Except code, token and key services, other services are protected by OAuth2 itself and additional security
as well. These sevices can be deployed at different locations within your network for maximum security and
flexibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;multiple-database-support&#34;&gt;Multiple Database Support&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently, Oralce, MySQL and Postgres are supported, but other databases(sql or nosql) can be easily supported
by implementing a MapStore of Hazelcast and create a initial db script.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;easy-to-customize-and-integrate&#34;&gt;Easy to customize and integrate&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each service can be easily customized and won&amp;rsquo;t impact other services. Also, it is very easy to extend in order
to integrate with other existing services within your organization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;three-editions-to-choose-from&#34;&gt;Three Editions to choose from&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given your development phase and production requirement, you can choose development edition,
enterprise edition and provider edition for your deployment.&lt;/p&gt;
